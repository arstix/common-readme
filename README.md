## Why?

We've created this project to simulate a payment processing page. The reason we've used React stack is it was the easiest one 
to develop on and which bringed the most features to build quicker. Furthermore:

1. Modules in React allowed us to build this project faster.

2. Components made the code be more organized and easier to find the things that we search for. 


## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed, run

```shell
run npm install 
```

You can now execute the `common-readme` command.
